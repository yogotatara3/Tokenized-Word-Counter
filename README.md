# Tokenized-Word-Counter
 This script processes .txt files in a specified folder, counting words with â‰¥3 characters, sorting by frequency, and saving results in tokenizer_word_counts.txt. It supports the --path argument via argparse and optionally integrates the T5 tokenizer (google/t5-v1_1-small) for tokenization and analysis.
